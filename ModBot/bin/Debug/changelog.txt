************************************************************************************

-------v1.02

Added a * after the user's name in the raffle winner output if the user is following the channel.
Added a "!top <x>" command for the channel admin.  Will return the top X amount of users with the most currency.
Added some sanity checks to the username, password, and channel fields of the start up UI.
Fixed a bug with closing raffles that had 0 tickets purchased.
Added some code to make backups of the currency database every time that ModBot is run.
Added a command for you to enable handouts to still go out even when the stream is offline.
Added a Message Box when you run the program to alert you when there's a new version ready to be downloaded.
Can no longer remove more currency from a user than they have available.  If you try, it will just set their currency to 0.



-------v1.01

Fixed "!raffle open" output to say <currency> instead of tokens.
Can now open raffles with 0 ticket cost.  Command is still the same.  Ex: !raffle open 0 1 would be a raffle where everyone in the channel can buy 1 ticket and it doesn't cost them any coins.
"!raffle close" and "!raffle draw" now have an optional third parameter where you can specify how many people to draw.  Ex:  "!raffle close 3" will draw 3 winners.  "!raffle close" by itself will still draw 1 winner.
Custom commands now handle "@user" in them in the same way that greetings do.  For instance, if you did "!mod addcommand 0 !hello Hello, @user.", then someone in your channel named Keirathi typed "!hello", the bot would reply with "Hello, Keirathi."
Added About button to the startup GUI.
Added tooltips to startup GUI.
The channel admin can now type !<currency> <user> to check a specific user's amount of currency.
Added reconnecting to the channel after disconnects.
Removed some superfluous error messages from showing up in the console window/Error_Log.log
Fixed a bug in the !ticket command that wouldn't allow you to buy your max amount of <currency> worth of tickets
